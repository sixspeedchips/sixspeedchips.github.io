### Current Interests and Projects

- [Attraction/repulsion](https://github.com/swandivejack/n-bodies-v2) 
	An n-body simulation with various bodies sporting different characteristics, Some bodies are attracted to other bodies and some are repulsed.
- Finish coding keras inspired neural network frame work in python via numpy
- Self playing pong game with multiple balls in java where the paddle is controlled by a algorithm that can only apply force and not directly set the position.
- MCTS ticktacktoe self play algorithm.
	explore MCTS and self play algorithms by training a ANN to play tic-tac-toe through repetitive self-play in the style of alpha-zero.
- [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/swandivejack/conways-game-of-life):
	a Javafx implementation of game of life
- [Genetic Draw](https://github.com/swandivejack/ga-draw-java)
	A genetic algorithm which tries to match input images under constraints. Implemented using open-cv for the Matrices and quick MSE fitness function.
- Tessellator
    Tessellate input images using a genetic algorithm to refine a population of polygons with shared vertices.
- Explore Attractor graphing in java
- Explore Fractals in Java
	Graph Mandelbrot's set in java, exploration of Julia sets.
- Build a Comment-bot
	Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation build a online comment bot that matches comments with corresponding quote from a repertoire.
- [Blockchain chat](https://github.com/swandivejack/com-chain)
	Implement a blockchain using the bitcoin core as a guide that has a decentralized chatting service with each user doing POW to build a blockchain of comments
- Revisiting Numerical analysis
	rewrite the rootfinding, splines, interpolative algorithms, and quadrature from numerical analysis classes.
- [Maze builder](https://github.com/swandivejack/maze-builder) animations using DFS 
- [Card-Contact](contact-card-android/)
    Android app using open-cv and tesseract to identify business cards from an image and parse texts containing names, emails, and phone numbers.
