# Ideas for projects

- Attraction/repulsion
	An n-body simulation where the various bodies have different properties. Some bodies are attracted to other bodies and some are repulsed.
- Finish coding keras inspired neural network frame work in python on numpy
- Self playing pong game with multiple balls in java where the paddle is controlled by a algorithm that can only apply force and not directly set the position.
- MCTS ticktacktoe self play algorithm.
	explore MCTS and self play algorithms by training a ANN to play tictactoe through repetitive self-play in the style of alpha-zero.
- (Conway's game of life)[https://github.com/swandivejack/conways-game-of-life]:
	a Javafx implementation of game of life
- Genetic Draw
	A genetic algorithm which tries to match input images under constraints. Port the python implementations of this into java, still need to conceive a way to map between images placed in an array and their renderings in JavaFX.
- Explore Attractor graphing in java
- Explore Fractals in Java
	Graph mandelbrot's set in java, and explore julia sets.
- Build a chatbot based on LDA
	Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation build a online comment bot that matches comments with corresponding quote from a repertoire.
- (Blockchain chat)[https://github.com/swandivejack/com-chain]
	Implement a blockchain using the bitcoin core as a guide that has a decentralized chatting service with each user doing POW to build a blockchain of comments
- Revisit Numerical analysis
	rewrite the rootfinding, splines and interpolative algorithms from my numerical analysis classes.
