### Current Interests

- Attraction/repulsion N-bodies
	An n-body simulation with various bodies sporting different characteristics, Some bodies are attracted to other bodies and some are repulsed.
- Finish coding keras inspired neural network frame work in python via numpy
- Self playing pong game with multiple balls in java where the paddle is controlled by a algorithm that can only apply force and not directly set the position.
- MCTS ticktacktoe self play algorithm.
	explore MCTS and self play algorithms by training a ANN to play tictactoe through repetitive self-play in the style of alpha-zero.
- (Conway's game of life)[https://github.com/swandivejack/conways-game-of-life]:
	a Javafx implementation of game of life
- Genetic Draw
	A genetic algorithm which tries to match input images under constraints. Port the python implementations of this into java, still need to conceive a way to map between images placed in an array and their renderings in JavaFX.
- Explore Attractor graphing in java
- Explore Fractals in Java
	Graph Mandelbrot's set in java, exploration of Julia sets.
- Build a Commentbot
	Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation build a online comment bot that matches comments with corresponding quote from a repertoire.
- (Blockchain chat)[https://github.com/swandivejack/com-chain]
	Implement a blockchain using the bitcoin core as a guide that has a decentralized chatting service with each user doing POW to build a blockchain of comments
- Revisiting Numerical analysis
	rewrite the rootfinding, splines, interpolative algorithms, and quadrature from numerical analysis classes.
